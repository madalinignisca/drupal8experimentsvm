# Drupal 8 experiments by @madalinignisca

This are some experiments on my own trying concepts of advanced editing of
content using as much as possible only the Core and minimal contrib modules.

Currently:

  * Referenced block of content within the Node.
    Examples:
    * An Article node can reference a pre-made Hero custom Block so this kind of blocks
      can be reused. - in configs âˆš
    * A Page node can reference a custom Slider Block - wip
